            <h1>Mobile App Design</h1>
            <p>
            Mobile app designers are always looking for the right tool that will make
             their designs worthwhile for the end user experience. 
            Developing a valuable mobile app requires top notch skill, 
            creativity, and of course the right tools.

            <h3>WHAT IS APP-DEGIN</h3>
            <p>
            App design is the look and feel of a mobile application. 
            This includes all of the visual elements and interactive elements
             that impact how the app functions.

            Mobile app design combines two concepts—UI and UX.

            The user interface (UI) encompasses the app’s look and feel.           
            It includes color, font, app style, and similar design choices.
            The user experience (UX) design prioritizes the app’s functions and use.
